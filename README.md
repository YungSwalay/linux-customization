# linux-customization
My personal Linux/GNOME customization files

Ulitmately, a `Makefile` should be composed, which when:

`make install`

is executed will install the files in this repositiory into their appropriate
locations so that the system is customized in the way "the way I like".

Because I tend to use different flavors of Linux for work and play and I do
experiment with different varieties of Linux, it is expected that occasional
issues may emerge with, for example, `.bashrc`, which may perform different
tasks and call on different files in RHEL based vs. Debian based systems.
